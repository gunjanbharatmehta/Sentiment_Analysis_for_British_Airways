# British Airways Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of customer feedback and reviews for British Airways (BA), the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom. The objective is to extract insights from customer reviews to improve the overall customer experience and make data-driven decisions.

I have collected and analyzed customer feedback data from a third-party source, specifically from the website called Skytrax. By leveraging analytical techniques and tools, I have uncovered valuable insights to drive key business decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

## Task Details
1. Scrape Data from the Web
To start the analysis, I utilized web scraping techniques to collect customer review data from Skytrax. The focus was on gathering reviews that specifically addressed the airline itself. By using the provided "Jupyter Notebook" in the Resources section, I ran Python code to scrape the necessary data.

2. Analyze Data
Once the dataset was collected, the next step involved preparing and cleaning the data for analysis. The raw data was in a messy format and consisted mainly of text. To extract meaningful insights, I performed data cleaning procedures. Afterward, I conducted various analyses using Python and other relevant tools.

## Some suggested analysis techniques included:
- Topic Modeling: Identifying key themes and topics within the reviews.
- Sentiment Analysis: Evaluating the sentiment of customer feedback (positive, negative, neutral).
- Word Clouds: Visualizing the most frequent words or phrases used in the reviews.
I utilized documentation websites provided in the Resources section to guide and support the data analysis process.

3. Present Insights
To effectively communicate the findings to the management team, I created a PowerPoint slide summarizing the key insights. The slide, presents visualizations and metrics that highlight the significant points from the analysis.
